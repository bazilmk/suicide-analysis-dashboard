### Dashboard
- Created a single-page interactive visualization dashboard using Dash (Plotly) with multi-select features.
- Dashboard consists of an interactive choropleth map, scatter plot, box-and-whisker plot and parallel coordinate plot.
- All plots are updated simulataneously based on click based selection / interaction on any one plot and/or from adjusting the header options.
